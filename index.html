          <h3>Zimkitha Macengulashe Zilo</h3> <p>started reading at a very early age. She says reading has made her a more aware person, boosted her confidence levels, and literally made her an encyclopedia of random facts.
            Originally from the Free State, she moved to Cape Town where she resided in Khayelitsha.</p>
            <h3>The Booknics</h3>
           <p> Seeing children loitering in the streets with nothing to do and the streets flooded with alcohol bottles and cigarette stompies, she would envision 
          the whole streets flooded with booksand children reading instead of finishing off alcohol bottles and pretending to smoke. So as a way to bring her imaginary book flooding, she has children's book clubs around Khayelitsha and
          also reads in the Pediatric ward of Khayelitsha District Hospital.She gets her books from the center of books and so far, she hasn't had a shortage of books which is "amazing" in her own words. 
         She says she is hoping to have these Booknics in every township, however funds or rather resources are limiting her to just Makhaya and Kuyasa</p>

        <h4 class="card-title">Finding uLoyiso eLokshini</h4>
        <p class="card-text">A coming of age story about growing up in Khayelitsha at the height of apartheid. Loyiso recounts a happy childhood, despite his father’s drinking and his mother’s intermittent hospitalization for an unnamed illness.
          He was born in 1978, to parents that were both teachers. He grows up in a tight-knit family surrounded by extended family and the neighbours that become his surrogate family when his parents separate, and later on when his mother goes to study further – leaving him and his siblings with their grandparents.
          He writes about his primary school years and the enduring friendships; his high school years where he discovered his love for sports; the year he spent at boarding school in the Eastern Cape and his subsequent return to Cape Town, and about the ensuing years when his mother begins going to church – something she had never done before .The writing on his reluctance to embrace his mother’s new-found faith makes for entertaining reading. His teenage years, typical in the way of most teenagers – dating, hanging out with friends and grappling with impending adulthood – are all told with humour.
          After matric, he becomes a guide in wilderness camps. This paves the way for his travel to the US, where he works as a camp counsellor for over five years. The second half of the manuscript focuses on his work, his personal life, and his professional growth.
          This latter part is about his adult relationships, his growing family responsibilities, and his work as a leadership coach for post-matric students.

It is a story of an authentic quest for true reconciliation ... He left the rural life of the Eastern Cape without expecting how his deepest understanding of ubuntu (umntu ngumntu ngabantu), meaning I am because we are ... would be challenged." from the foreword by Nelis Janse van Rensburg, Moderator of the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa

        <h3>Khayelitsha Book Festival</h3> <p>On a mission to fulfill her vision for the book flood, Ms Zilo is using the September book week to close off a street and have boks everywhere.
          She says she wants to introduce reading for pleasure in the township and she wants to encourage writere to publish theirwork and have published prominent authors share their journeys
          of being published authors, she wants being a writer to be a career option. She says she wants the culture of reading to be cool and be a thing and she knows that a book festival can 
          accomplish that. She even bought tickets for some of her teens to come to one book festival and it turned out to be an academic debate space, which was lovely, however, it didn't sell the idea 
          of readingas cool. She says hosting this book festival will speak what she actually wants books and reading to be.
